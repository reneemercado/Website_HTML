	<h3> Project 2.1.6 - pHishy Tank Project</h3>
	<h4> By: Renee Mercado and Hope Siapno</h4>
	<p> In this assignment, we utilized our knowledge of phishing and debugging to help fix the fish tank monitors.</p>
	<p> Through this project, we were able to locate the data breach and how to prevent it in the future!</p>

	<h3> Project 4.1.4 - Strong Acid + Base NetLogo Simulation</h3>
	<h4> By: Renee Mercado and Kat Radibratovic</h4>
	<p> In this assignment, we utlized the simulation system, NetLogo, to complete a virtual experiment regarding acids and bases.</p>
	<p> Through this project, we were able to understand the effects of adding base(solution with a high pH) to a strong acid(solution with low pH) without the dangers that would be present in an actual lab.</p>

	<h3> Project 3.1.6 - Rover Phone Home</h3>
	<h4> By: Renee Mercado and Abigail Thai</h4>
	<p> We concluded that the rover was lost in the Rocky Mountain biome.In this project we determined where to split up the data by graphing the raw data onto one graph. From the raw graph data we found the points that exhibited the largest change in value. These points were where we split up the data. We concluded the Rocky Mountain biome based on our created graphs based on the raw data from the rover. In our temperature graph, we observed cold starting temperature with a peak in temperature which represents lower temperatures that heat up quickly which is concurrent with the Rocky Mountain biome. In our light graph, we observed constant a wave with increasing and decreasing segments. These segments of changing value can be accounted the occasional clouds that pass over the rover. The graph is also located relatively higher nearing 70 which can be explained in the Rocky Mountain biome as the bright, intense light during the daytime. In out gyroscope graph, we observed peaks and valleys in our graph. The change in angular position can be explained by how the rover is going over rocky terrain which is concurrent with the Rocky Mountain biome. In our sound graph, we observed small variation that was constant throughout the graph. This can represent how there are constant winds but varying intensity which is representative with the Rocky Mountain biome.</p>
